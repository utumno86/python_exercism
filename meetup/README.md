end in '-teenth'. Therefore, one is guaranteed that each day of the week
(Monday, Tuesday, ...) will have exactly one date that is named with '-teenth'

<<<<<<< HEAD
Given examples of a meetup dates, each containing a month, day, year, and descriptor

For example, if given "First Monday of January 2017", the correct meetup date is 2017/1/2
